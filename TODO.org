* Integrating with RV32I Compliance Test

** Test halting

Communication between simulator and program is done through IO port 0x80000000

- 0 -- Initiate memory scan
- 1 -- Test pass
- 2 -- Test fail
- 3 -- Test halt

** Architecture modifications

- [X] Reset handler only
- [X] Exception handler must be modifiable via mtvec
- [X] Writable mstatus register

** Prepare for Zephyr
- [X] Port to Zephyr toolchain
- [X] Port Zephyr OS
- [X] Implement ECALL and EBREAK
- [X] Implement mtime and mtimecmp
- [X] Implement system timer interrupt
- [X] For now, increase size of ROM to 15kB
- [X] Use 16kx16 SPRAM as main memory
- [X] Reduce ROM size to 12kB
- [X] Make ROM synthesizable
- [X] Create cpu_top module and its simulator
- [ ] Make cpu_top synthesizable
